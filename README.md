# Quantum Consciousness Fields (QCF_RICT)

This repository contains the full theoretical, simulation, and documentation package for **Quantum Consciousness Fields (QCF)** and **Recursive Informational Coherence Theory (RICT)** by William Shane Buckner Jr.

---

## 📘 Overview

**Recursive Informational Coherence Theory (RICT)** posits that consciousness and systemic coherence emerge from recursive feedback between an agent’s memory field and its informational state. This framework integrates quantum mechanics, cognitive neuroscience, bioelectrical coherence, artificial intelligence, and social system theory.

The central hypothesis:  
> *All coherent systems evolve by minimizing informational dissonance and maximizing coherence through recursive, memory-mediated feedback loops.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Python 3.8+**

2. **Install required dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run simulations** to observe key theoretical behaviors:
- `anchor_emergence.py` – Models stabilization of coherence anchors.
- `entropy_memory_tradeoff.py` – Shows coherence–entropy dynamics.
- `dipole_coherence.py` – Quantum/molecular resonance field simulation.
- `eeg_coherence.py` – Simulates bioelectric coherence like EEG wave patterns.

4. **Compile the manuscript**:
Use any LaTeX environment (e.g., Overleaf, TeX Live, or TeXworks) to compile `paper/main.tex`.
