## ðŸ§ª How to Run Simulations and Compile Manuscript

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Simulations
Navigate to the `simulations/` folder and run any of the following scripts:

- `anchor_emergence.py`: Simulates emergence of stable coherence anchors over time.
- `entropy_memory_tradeoff.py`: Demonstrates the relationship between entropy, memory accumulation, and coherence field stability.
- `dipole_coherence.py`: Models dipole-driven coherence dynamics, reflecting physical resonance effects.
- `eeg_coherence.py`: Simulates coherence field patterns analogous to EEG rhythms in biological systems.

Each script outputs data to the console or plots visualizations using `matplotlib`.

Example usage:
```bash
python simulations/anchor_emergence.py
```

### 3. Compile the LaTeX Manuscript
Use any LaTeX compiler (TeX Live, Overleaf, or TeXworks) to compile the theoretical manuscript:

- Navigate to the `paper/` directory.
- Compile `main.tex` which automatically includes all appendices (Aâ€“E).
